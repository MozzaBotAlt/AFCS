# AFCS
Ain Faraid Calculation System, AFCS. Faraid calculator obeying the laws of Islam. Created by Ms. Ain Syafiqah of MRSM Langkawi and produced by Long Infinity of MozzaBot. For the benefit of the people.

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> The application has been converted to a **purely frontend** implementation. All calculation logic now runs in the browser using Pyodide (Python interpreter compiled to WebAssembly). There is no longer a Flask API; the original Python modules (`Faraid.py`, `HeirsDict.py`, `Functions.py`) are retained for reference and are loaded by the frontend loader script.
